# Outlook extended

* Authors: Cyrille Bougot, Ralf Kefferpuetz
* NVDA compatibility: 2019.3 and beyond
* Download [stable version][1]

This addon improves the use of Microsoft Outlook with NVDA: it vocalizes some native commands and adds extra commands and features.

## Commands

* Alt+1 to Alt+9, Alt+0, Alt+-, Alt+=: Reports the header field 1 to 12 in a message, calendar item or task window. If pressed twice, moves the focus to this field if possible. If pressed three times, copies its content to the clipboard.
* NVDA+shift+I (desktop layout) / NVDA+control+shift+I (laptop layout): Reports the information bar in a message, calendar item or task window. If pressed twice, moves the focus to it. If pressed three times, copies its content to the clipboard.
* NVDA+shift+A (desktop layout) / NVDA+control+shift+A (laptop layout): Reports the number and the names of attachments in a message window. If pressed twice, moves the focus to it.
* NVDA+shift+M (desktop layout) / NVDA+control+shift+M (laptop layout): Moves the focus to the message body.
* NVDA+shift+N (desktop layout) / NVDA+control+shift+N (laptop layout): Reports the notification in a message window. If pressed twice, moves the focus to it. If pressed three times, copies its content to the clipboard.
* Control+Q: in the message list, marks the selected message or group of messages as read.
* Control+U: in the message list, marks the selected message or group of messages as unread.

## Additional improvements

* When the recipient you have entered in the To, Cc or Bcc fields sends automatic out of office replies or is not present anymore on the Exchange server, Outlook report it in the notification area of the message window. In this notification area, you also have buttons to remove the address of these recipients.
  This add-on will inform you with a ding when this notification area appears, disappears or is updated. You can then press NVDA+shif+N / NVDA+control+shift+N once to have it read and twice to jump to this area. Then move with the arrows on the recipient buttons and press a button to remove the corresponding recipient.
* In the address book's result list, you can use horizontal table navigation commands to read the content of each column.
  
## Notes

All the gestures can be modified in the NVDA command gestures dialog. You may want to modify them especially in the following situations:

* The default gestures to mark messages as read or unread are the ones for Outlook english version. If they differ from the ones of your Outlook local version, you will have to change them accordingly.
* The default gestures to read headers correspond to Alt combined with the keys of the first row of the alpha-numeric keyboard. You may need to re-map the gestures tor read header 11 and 12 if they do not match your local keyboard layout.
